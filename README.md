Repository to hold Saturday Fintech class materials


Who are you? What is your background? 

    My name is Ramana Challa, born in India and coming from a STEM background.

What are your career goals?

    My short term goals include trying to find a foothold in the finance industry and as a long term goal, I wish to become a pioneer of change in the Fintech domain.


 Why did you choose FinTech as a career path? 

    I have had about 13 years of working experience in IT and I wish to apply the skills I acquired during this journey to Fintech. I understand that the current scenario of Finance is getting disrupted by Fintech and I see that this is going to be a paradigm changer. I wish to be part of this paradigm shift and also I want to ensure I have the appropriate skills to navigate myself through this change.
